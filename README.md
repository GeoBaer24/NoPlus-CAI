# NoPlus

Hi! I'm Geo. And I'm here to introduce you to **NoPlus**. An extension changing some Features on [character.ai](https://beta.character.ai).

# Heads up!

You're currently looking at the **untested** Branch. Features here are not tested on the Official Website, so they might be unstable or break stuff.
If you have any Problems using the extension, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/GeoBaer24/NoPlus-CAI/issues/new) or send me a PM on my [Reddit](https://reddit.com/u/JustACruiser).

# Features

There's two features as of right now.

The first one is removing the "Get c.ai+" Button on Chats and the Character Selection screen.
AKA this: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GeoBaer24/NoPlus-CAI/untested/MEDIA/Button.png">

And secondly, I have made the Waiting Room more bearable when the site is down or something.
Here's how it should look like: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GeoBaer24/NoPlus-CAI/untested/MEDIA/WaitingRoom.png">

## Installation instructions

First off, like before, this is a chrome extension. So you'll need a Chrome-based Browser like Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc... 
I'm sorry, if you're using Firefox. You can use [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) to achieve the First Feature.

**Step 1**: Clone this repository: Click the **Code** Button at the Top, then click **Download ZIP**. Extract the ZIP file when downloaded.

**Step 2 (optional)**: If where the Folder is distracts you, move the extracted folder to somewhere where it's not disturbing you. Like your Documents Folder.

**Step 3**: Visit your Extensions Page and enable the Developer Mode. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the Folder that you've extracted.
> NOTE: To visit Chrome's Extensions Page, go to your settings and click "Extensions" or type [ chrome://extensions ] into your URL-Bar.
> NOTE: This is needed because I don't have this extension on the Chrome Web Store yet. I feel like it's kind of too early.

**Congrats**! You've just installed NoPlus. Enjoy. If you have any simple Feature requests, [open an Issue](https://github.com/GeoBaer24/NoPlus-CAI/issues/new) or contact me on [Reddit](https://reddit.com/u/JustACruiser).
