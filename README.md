# NoPlus

Hi! I'm Geo. And I'm here to introduce you to **NoPlus** (aka the extension I made in 5 minutes using ChatGPT to remove that button with that Feature everybody is complaining about).

# Features

It removes this Button:

That's it.

## OMG!!! I NEED THIS!!!!!!

Calm down, I'll explain. First off, this is a chrome extension. So you'll need a Chrome-based Browser. Sorry, if you're using Firefox.

**Step 1**: Clone this repository. Sound complex? Click the **Code** Button at the Top, then click **Download ZIP**. Extract it when downloaded.

**Step 2 (optional)**: Move the extracted folder to somewhere where it's not disturbing you. Like your Documents Folder.

**Step 3**: Visit Chrome's Extensions Page and enable the Developer Mode. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the Folder that you've extracted.
> To visit Chrome's Extensions Page, use the settings or type [ chrome://extensions ] into your URL-Bar.

**Congrats**! You've just installed an Extension. Good job.

## Support me (Optional)
